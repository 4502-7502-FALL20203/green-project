				My Statement:
			</h1>

			<p class="description1">

		Overall, I wanted my site to reflect my own personal interests, which can hopefully be seen throughout the pages I chose to create. My list page revolves around movies, which is a huge personal love of mine (especially ones directed by Greta Gerwig). Similarly, in my location page I chose to create a list of the best local concert venues because music is another big hobby of mine, and instead of collecting material items like cards/figurines, I collect concerts. Ending with my photo gallery, I decided to do a baking tutorial because baking and cooking are two of my most recent hobbies I’ve taken up, and while I would’ve done a more complicated recipe, I think there would’ve been too many photos. I also added my portfolio in there just for good measure. Hopefully, after clicking through my site you were able to learn a little bit more about me.
	
		Moving onto some of my design choices, my goal was to create something that was equal parts fun and accessible. For my color palette, I chose to go with cooler colors, like purples and blues, but included some brighter shades of those colors to make it a bit more dynamic. I wanted to create a fun experience, but not so fun that it’s overwhelming to look at. As far as actual design elements go, most of it for me was intuitive. Based on what I’ve learned in my other design classes within the J-school, I tried to use visual hierarchy fundamentals to create a site that was equal parts cohesive and accessible. I utilized a lot of box elements to hopefully make the site a little easier to read, but I can definitely admit I don’t have all of my design knowledge down to a perfect science quite yet. In terms of accessibility, I think I can always look for ways to improve, I included skip-links and alt-text but that’s not always enough!
		
		Thank you for taking a look at my site! J4502 has taught me a lot of web design and accessibility, and I’m excited to take these skills with me through the rest of my career.
